- main: fix race when looking up an inode that was renamed.

  to store the overlay metadata instead of trusted.overlay, let's
  honor it as well.
- main: add a mount flag to disable ACLs.

* fuse-overlayfs-1.7.1

- set FUSE_CAP_POSIX_ACL only when it is supported by FUSE.
- treat statx failure with EINVAL as ENOSYS, so that the fallback
  is attempted.

- don't create whiteout files in opaque dirs.
- fix reading files when running with euid != 0.
- enable POSIX ACLs.

* fuse-overlayfs-1.6

- fix an invalid access when filtering internal xattrs that could
  deal to a segfault.

- use strncpy instead of strcpy
- fix renameat2(RENAME_NOREPLACE) on older kernels that lack
  device whiteouts for unprivileged users.

- fix copyup of xattrs longer than 256 bytes.

* fuse-overlayfs-1.4

- add squash_to_uid and squash_to_gid

* fuse-overlayfs-1.3

- add squash_to_root mount option.
- honor option "volatile".
- when writing mode to xattr, create files with mode 0755.
- support ID mapping when using xattr permissions.
- allow opening not accessible but still referenced files.
- invalidate directory cache on create/rename.

* fuse-overlayfs-1.2

- fix segfault if no mountpoint specified
- fix file_exists_at musl compatibility
- introduce extended attribute to override gid/uid/mode.
- support writing uid/gid/mode to an extended attribute.
- fix a memory leak, where inodes are maintained in memory even if not needed.

* fuse-overlayfs-1.1.2

- fix build issues with libmusl.
- fix memory leak when creating whiteout files.

* fuse-overlayfs-1.1.1

- fix lookup for overflow uid when it is different than the overflow gid.

* fuse-overlayfs-1.1.0

- use openat2(2) when available.
- accept "ro" as mount option.
- fix set mtime for a symlink.
- fix some issues reported by static analysis.
- fix potential infinite loop on a short read.
- fix creating a directory if the destination already exists in the upper layer.

* fuse-overlayfs-1.0.0

- fix portability issue to 32 bits archs.

* fuse-overlayfs-0.7.8

- report correctly the number of links for a directory also for subsequent stat calls.
- stop looking up the ino in the lower layers if the file could not be opened.

* fuse-overlayfs-0.7.7

- make sure the destination is deleted before doing a rename(2).  It prevents a left
  over directory to cause delete to fail with EEXIST.
- honor --debug.

* fuse-overlayfs-0.7.6

- do not look in lower layers for the ino if there is no origin xattr set.
- attempt to use the file path if the operation on the fd fails with ENXIO.

* fuse-overlayfs-0.7.5

- do not expose internal xattrs through listxattr and getxattr.

* fuse-overlayfs-0.7.4

- fix fallocate for deleted files.
- ignore O_DIRECT.  It causes issues with libfuse not using an aligned buffer, causing
  write(2) to fail with EINVAL.
- on copyup, do not copy the opaque xattr.
- fix a wrong lookup for whiteout files, that could happen on a double unlink.

* fuse-overlayfs-0.7.3

- fix build with -fno-common
- fix possible segmentation fault in direct_fsync()
- use the data store to create missing whiteouts.
- after a rename, force a directory reload.

* fuse-overlayfs-0.7.2

- drop special handling for security.capability.

* fuse-overlayfs-0.7.1

- fix an issue where a whiteout in the parent directory could hide
  files in the sub directories.

* fuse-overlayfs-0.7

- plugins support.  It allows to read the lower layers from a different data source.
- support running without an upper layer in read only mode.
- honor opaque whiteouts.

* fuse-overlayfs-0.6.5

- stat reports correctly the number of links for a directory.

* fuse-overlayfs-0.6.4

- do not lose the setuid bit after a write when the writeback cache is used.
- skip creating a whiteout if the node is present only on the upper layer.

* fuse-overlayfs-0.6.3

- correctly delete an existing whiteout when the file is recreated (regression introduced with 0.5).
- fix ioctl on directories.

* fuse-overlayfs-0.6.2

- avoid ino lookup if not necessary.
- include st_dev in the hash key.  Now the same inode number can be safely used by lower
  directories on different file systems.

* fuse-overlayfs-0.6.1

- fix a regression introduced with 0.6 where UNIX sockets could not be correctly created.

* fuse-overlayfs-0.6

- fix an issue where changes to an inode would not be visible from another hard link.
  The issue was always present but was made easier to reproduce with fuse-overlayfs 0.5
  that enables FUSE writeback by default.
